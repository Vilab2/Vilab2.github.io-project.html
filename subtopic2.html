            <td>The 2023 IC3 report documented over 55,000 complaints involving personal data breaches, reflecting how often cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to private systems and sensitive information. These incidents often involve attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in networks, software, or user credentials. Once criminals obtain unauthorized access, they can steal data, commit financial fraud, or engage in identity theft. The report emphasizes that data breaches frequently serve as the starting point for more severe forms of cybercrime, demonstrating how hacking continues to be a central method used to infiltrate systems. The scale of reported breaches highlights the ongoing need for stronger security controls, multi-factor authentication, and improved user awareness.</td>

            <td>CyberScoop’s summary of the 2024 IC3 report highlights that cyber-enabled fraud accounted for 83% of total reported losses, totaling $13.7 billion. The data also shows that older adults—especially individuals aged 60 and above—submitted the highest number of complaints and experienced the greatest financial harm. This trend suggests that certain age groups are more frequently targeted due to limited familiarity with digital threats or emotional manipulation used by scammers. The report also underscores the continued rise of hacking-related incidents that expose personal data or compromise accounts. Overall, the findings demonstrate the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the heightened need for stronger cybersecurity protections across all age demographics.</td>
