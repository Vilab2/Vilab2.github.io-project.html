            The Identity Theft Resource Center’s 2023 Trends Report found that 78% of all identity-compromise cases originated from scams, demonstrating how frequently criminals deceive individuals into giving away personal information. 
            The report shows that the most common form of identity misuse was account takeover (52%), where criminals gain control of existing accounts. 
            The second most prevalent type was new-account creation fraud (36%), in which offenders open new financial accounts using stolen credentials. 
            The report highlights rising sophistication among scammers, including methods such as fake job postings and phishing schemes designed to trick victims into revealing sensitive data. 
            These findings reveal how identity theft continues to evolve as criminals exploit both personal vulnerabilities and system weaknesses.

        <td>
            A 2024 study conducted by AARP and Javelin Strategy & Research reported that Americans lost an estimated $43 billion to identity fraud in 2023. 
            Traditional identity theft—such as using stolen personal information to make purchases or open accounts—accounted for $23 billion of these losses. 
            The report also identified major increases in account takeover fraud ($13 billion) and new-account fraud ($5.3 billion), suggesting criminals increasingly rely on stolen or compromised data to create entirely new identities or gain access to existing ones. 
            These findings highlight how identity theft remains one of the most financially damaging forms of cybercrime and emphasize the importance of strong digital hygiene and early detection strategies.
