    <h2>Subtopic 1: Online Fraud and Scams</h2>
    <h3>Source 1: IC3 / FBI – 2023 Internet Crime Report</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> FBI – Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</p>
    <p>In 2023, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 880,418 cybercrime complaints, showing how rapidly online fraud continues to grow. Reported financial losses exceeded $12.5 billion, which represents a 22% increase from 2022. The most frequently reported types of online fraud included investment scams, business email compromise (BEC), and tech-support scams. These schemes show how offenders use deceptive communication tactics and impersonation to exploit victims. The report highlights the continued evolution of online fraud, emphasizing that criminals shift strategies to target individuals across different digital platforms. Overall, the 2023 data demonstrates the significant scale of online fraud and the need for increased awareness and protective measures.</p>

    <h3>Source 2: IC3 / FBI – 2024 Internet Crime Report</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> FBI – Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</p>
    <p>According to the 2024 IC3 annual report, financial losses linked to cybercrime reached a record-breaking $16.6 billion, marking a 33% increase from the previous year. A large portion of this total came from cyber-enabled fraud, including phishing and spoofing attacks, extortion schemes, and intrusions involving stolen personal data. The report indicates that criminals continue refining their methods to deceive victims and exploit vulnerabilities in both personal and organizational systems. These upward trends highlight how widespread and costly online fraud has become, stressing the importance of improved cybersecurity practices and greater public education to help reduce victimization.</p>

    <h2>Subtopic 2: Hacking and Unauthorized Access</h2>
    <h3>Source 1: FBI / IC3 – 2023 Report on Personal Data Breaches</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> FBI – Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</p>
    <p>The 2023 IC3 report documented over 55,000 complaints involving personal data breaches, reflecting how often cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to private systems and sensitive information. These incidents often involve attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in networks, software, or user credentials. Once criminals obtain unauthorized access, they can steal data, commit financial fraud, or engage in identity theft. The report emphasizes that data breaches frequently serve as the starting point for more severe forms of cybercrime, demonstrating how hacking continues to be a central method used to infiltrate systems. The scale of reported breaches highlights the ongoing need for stronger security controls, multi-factor authentication, and improved user awareness.</p>

    <h3>Source 2: CyberScoop – Key Stats from the 2024 IC3 Report</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> CyberScoop</p>
    <p>CyberScoop’s summary of the 2024 IC3 report highlights that cyber-enabled fraud accounted for 83% of total reported losses, totaling $13.7 billion. The data also shows that older adults—especially individuals aged 60 and above—submitted the highest number of complaints and experienced the greatest financial harm. This trend suggests that certain age groups are more frequently targeted due to limited familiarity with digital threats or emotional manipulation used by scammers. The report also underscores the continued rise of hacking-related incidents that expose personal data or compromise accounts. Overall, the findings demonstrate the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the heightened need for stronger cybersecurity protections across all age demographics.</p>

    <h2>Subtopic 3: Identity Theft</h2>
    <h3>Source 1: Identity Theft Resource Center – 2023 Trends Report</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC)</p>
    <p>The Identity Theft Resource Center’s 2023 Trends Report found that 78% of all identity-compromise cases originated from scams, demonstrating how frequently criminals deceive individuals into giving away personal information. The report shows that the most common form of identity misuse was account takeover (52%), where criminals gain control of existing accounts. The second most prevalent type was new-account creation fraud (36%), in which offenders open new financial accounts using stolen credentials. The report highlights rising sophistication among scammers, including methods such as fake job postings and phishing schemes designed to trick victims into revealing sensitive data. These findings reveal how identity theft continues to evolve as criminals exploit both personal vulnerabilities and system weaknesses.</p>

    <h3>Source 2: AARP / Javelin Strategy & Research – Identity Fraud Report (2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Author / Organization:</strong> AARP; Javelin Strategy & Research</p>
    <p>A 2024 study conducted by AARP and Javelin Strategy & Research reported that Americans lost an estimated $43 billion to identity fraud in 2023. Traditional identity theft—such as using stolen personal information to make purchases or open accounts—accounted for $23 billion of these losses. The report also identified major increases in account takeover fraud ($13 billion) and new-account fraud ($5.3 billion), suggesting criminals increasingly rely on stolen or compromised data to create entirely new identities or gain access to existing ones. These findings highlight how identity theft remains one of the most financially damaging forms of cybercrime and emphasize the importance of strong digital hygiene and early detection strategies.</p>
