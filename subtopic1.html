            In 2023, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that there were over 880,000 cybercrime complaints, 
            with financial losses surpassing $12.5 billion, which was a 22% increase from the previous year. 
            Common scams included investment fraud, business email compromise, and tech-support scams. 
            These conclusions describe the ongoing evolution of online fraud tactics, as criminals continually adapt to prey on people 
            across different digital outlets. The notable scale of reported fraud underscores the need for improved awareness and 
            protective measures against these risks.

            The 2024 Internet Crime Complaint Center report showed that losses from cybercrime reached $16.6 billion, 
            a 33% increase from 2023. A substantial part came from cyber-enabled fraud, including phishing and extortion tactics. 
            The report highlights that criminals are becoming more refined in their techniques, exploiting personal and organizational vulnerabilities. 
            The rise in the statistics highlights the need for stronger security measures and public education to aid in mitigating victimization.
