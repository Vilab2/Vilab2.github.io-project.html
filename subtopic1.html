            According to the 2024 IC3 annual report, financial losses linked to cybercrime reached a record-breaking $16.6 billion, marking a 33% increase from the previous year. 
            A large portion of this total came from cyber-enabled fraud, including phishing and spoofing attacks, extortion schemes, and intrusions involving stolen personal data. 
            The report indicates that criminals continue refining their methods to deceive victims and exploit vulnerabilities in both personal and organizational systems. 
            These upward trends highlight how widespread and costly online fraud has become, stressing the importance of improved cybersecurity practices and greater public education to help reduce victimization.
